<h1>
Story Map Process
</h1>
<p>Using the ESRI Storymap site we created a three part story map (Beginning, Middle and End). Due in part to the 30 
point limit this did work in our favour as to not bombard the user with data points. The data is evenly distributed along the 
journey.</p>

<h3>Step One</h3>
<p>By clicking on the plus icon at the bottom of the page, we can then see a list of choices to choose from, Guided tour (beta) is what was chosen.</p>
<div class="imagecolumn">
<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/Guidedtour.PNG" alt = "GuidedTour">
</div>  
	  
<h3>Step Two</h3>
<p>After inserting the Guided tour (beta) we added 5 slides for the top 5 coordinates of each part of the 2-month journey accordingly. These will need to be updated to include the rest 
at a later date.
</p>
<div class="imagecolumn">
<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/AddingStory.PNG" alt = "AddingStory">
</div>  
	  
<h3>Step Three</h3>
<p>From here we could add in our historic data research of Treaty 9 to our liking.
</p>  
<div class="imagecolumn">
<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/MoreSlidePoints.PNG" alt = "MoreSlides">
</div>  
	  
<h3>Step Four</h3>	 
<p>
In order to place the coordinates it was a simple matter of selecting "Edit Location" on the slide.	
</p>
<div class="imagecolumn">
<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/EditLocation.PNG" alt = "EditLocation">
</div>
	  
<h3>Step Five</h3>
<p>A new window appeared, allowing us to type in the supplied coordinates of our client into the top left of the search bar. 
We could then simply click on the location where we wanted to place the coordinate, or click and drag the symbol 
if we were unsatisfied with its location. Doing this saved a lot of time as we were able to zoom in on our geographic 
locations quickly and place down the markers.</p>
<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/Tourpoints.PNG" alt="Tourpoints">
	  
<h3>Step Six</h3>
<p>We could then change the colour of the symbols within the Design tab. The site itself recommends 3 as shown below, or you can pick your own. For this project we 
chose to pick from one of the recommended colours.</p>
<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/Design.PNG" alt = "Design">

<h3>Repeat</h3>
<p>Then after that was done, the process was repeated for the middle and end of the jouney. A snippet of the final product of the story map is shown below.</p>
