Story Map Process
</h1>
<p>Using the ESRI Storymap site we were able to create a three part story map (Beginning, Middle and End). By clicking on the plus icon
at the bottom of the page, we can then see a list of choices to choose from, Guided tour (beta) is what was chosen.</p>
	<div class="imagecolumn">
	<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/Guidedtour.PNG" alt = "GuidedTour">
	  </div>  
<p>After inserting the Guided tour (beta) we added 5 slides for the top 5 coordinates of each part of the 2-month journey accordingly. These will need to be updated to include the rest 
at a later date.
</p>
	  <div class="imagecolumn">
	<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/AddingStory.PNG" alt = "AddingStory">
	  </div>  
	  <p>From here we could add in our historic data research of Treaty 9 to our liking.</p>
	  
	   <div class="imagecolumn">
	<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/MoreSlidePoints.PNG" alt = "MoreSlides">
	  </div>  
	  
<p>
In order to place the coordinates it was a simple matter of selecting "Edit Location" on the slide.	
</p>
<div class="imagecolumn">
	<img class="tour" src= "Pictures/EditLocation.PNG" alt = "EditLocation">
	  </div>
<p>A new window appeared allowing us to type in the supplied coordinates in the top left of the search bar. Doing 
this saved a lot of time as we were able to zoom in on our geographic locations and place down the markers.</p>

<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/Tourpoints.PNG" alt="Tourpoints">
<p>We could then change the colour of the symbols in the Design tab. The site itself recommends 3 as shown below, or you can pick your own. For this prototype we 
chose to pick from one of the recommended colours.</p>

	<img class="location9" src= "Pictures/Design.PNG" alt = "Design">


<p>Then after that was completed it was duplicated two other time for the middle of the journey and end. A snippet of the final product of the story map is shown below.</p>
