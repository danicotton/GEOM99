    <h2>Title: K-12 Interactive Story Map of Treaty 9</h2>
	  <h3> Group 3: Katelyn Corrigall-Millins, Danielle Cotton, Craig Harding, Marissa Powell</h3>
	  <h3> Ideal: </h3>
	  <p> A more visually appealing, and interactive version of the Treaty 9 Canoe Route that will be moving onto a website for community outreach</p>
	  <h3> Reality: </h3>
	  <ul> <li> Poor user interface </li> <li> lack of interactivity </li> </ul>
	  <h3> Consequences </h3> 
	  <ul> <li> The current version of the map will eventually need to be updated to mirror the finished collaborative project </li>
		  <li> Limits community outreach </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3> Proposal: Create a fun learning environment to learn about Treaty 9 </h3>
	  <h2> Did we Manage it? You be the Judge! </h2>
	  <p> Our idea for a a simple, but interactive, user-interface was going to be challenging. After examining several other 
		  story maps, like <a href="https://arcg.is/08HG1X0"> Turtle Island </a>, we decided to move forward and create a similar idea. 
		  The main idea behind the Turtle Island layout was one master map that linked to all other smaller themed maps, documents, and websites.</p>
		  <p>Our focuses were: The Route/journey the commissioners took in three maps combined; Wildlife- an entire page devolted to wildlife and their spottings; 
		  Landscape- an examination of the changing landscape inside Treaty 9 territory; Canoes- a slideshow on the types of canoes that were used by the crew;
		  Portaging- A brief description for the general public with stock photographs; we also included seperate links to the treaty in the cultural heritage page. We did this
		  because we wanted to ensure it was correct information and we must discuss it further with our client. Our prototypes are brief, with only a few 
		  slides/maps per each map to highlight the information and the different ways we can portray it. </p>
	  <p> Once that was complete we created a main page to host all of the general information and link all storymaps to it. In the final product this 
		  page will be more polished and possibly have another layout due to the changing themes and client requierments </p>
		  <p>More can be seen on our other pages, please enjoy!</p>
