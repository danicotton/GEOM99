<h1> Tasks Involved: </h1> 

<h2>Client Meeting</h2> 

	<ul> 
		<li>Our first order of business was to have a meeting with the client to determine their needs and wants, so we could determine how to best move forward </li> 
		<li>Once we determined that the client, Kelly, would like a more user-friendly interface that is more engaging and fun we needed to examine the various products</li> 
	</ul> 
<h2> Product Exploration </h2> 
	<ul> 
		<li> Like a kid in a candy shop we set off exploring what ESRI had to offer us in the line of StoryMaps </li> 
		<li>We also looked at what others had done for Indigenous Treaty works using storymaps. In doing so we found something called <a href= "https://arcg.is/08HG1X0"> Turtle Island </a> </li> 
	</ul> 

<div class = "ImageTeamwork">

	Time To Create!  </h2> 
</div>	
	<ul>
		<li>Our next task was creating several rapid prototypes to determine how we wanted to display the maps and what we could do with it</li> 
		<li>Each team member created a rapid prototype for a storymap. We discussed and dissected them to see how it could be made to be more interactive</li> 
		<li>In the end we settled on something akin to what we had already seen in the Turtle Island storymap</li> 
	</ul>
<h2>The Product:</h2> 
	<ul> 
	<li>Each team member was tasked with creating an aspect of the StoryMap for the final product
		<ul><li>They could use any version of a storymap they wished</li> 
			<li>Used buttons, quotes, images</li> 
			<li>The aim was to make it different, fun, and engaging for the average user</li> </ul>
	<li>Once All were complete it was added to the main map in a pleasing and engaging way</li> 
	  </ul>
