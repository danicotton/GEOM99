    <h2>Onwards to Glory!</h2>
	  <p> In our most recent communication with the client the scope of the project has changed.</p>
	  <p> Due to the Novel Coronavirus the client will be unable to provide images/photos for the broad public program phase and we shall have to change the storymap focuses appropriately </p>
	  <h3> New Project Scope </h3>
	  <ul> 
		 <li> Producing a hard copy map of the 1905 Treaty no. 9 route: highlighting the Treaty signing communities visited, 
			 and combining the coordinate features listed in each of the Crews (rapids, portages, lakes, rivers, etc.) to one map. 
		  </li>
	 	<li> Creating GIS story maps of the territory in layered themes. These these are as follows: </li>
		  <ul> <li> Geographical Features- Lakes and Rivers, Elevation, Ecology, Ecosystems </li>
			  <li> Flora and Fauna- Water Plants, including wild rice, fish, wildlife, trees, birds </li>
			  <li> Impact of Industry along route: Hydro-Electric Dams and Power and Paper Companies </li>
			  <li> Treaty Communities- Arts and Culture, Language, Youth Initiatives; current reserves and former Hudsons Bay Trading Posts </li>
		  </ul>
	  </ul>
	 <p> Much of what we have in scope of the storymap can remain; however, due to the lack of images we will have to make it more map focused or aquire stock images </p>
	  <p> Currently our idea of themed maps is a success with the client; we will meet to discuss with her regarding the added themes we created in our prototype scope </p>
