<h2>Museum Temporary Closure</h2> 

<p>The Peterborough Canadian Canoe Museum’s temporary closure, due to the Novel Coronavirus has made it difficult to visit or acquire 
any on-site personally taken pictures that we could use for the project. Due to the layoffs at the Museum our advisor, Shawn Morgan, will be taking over
	the handling of the project. </p>

<h2>Client Symbols</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
The client was pleased with the work that Fleming College had done for them the previous year and wished to continue using some objects from last years endavour.</li>
<li>They had created a custom symbol of a tree to symbolize the route that the Commissioner's had taken; the tree symbol in 
question is not available for us at this time due to difficulties with the Coronavirus </li> 
</ul> 
 
<h2>StoryMap Geographic Location Limit</h2> 
<ul> 
<li> 
ESRI’s StoryMap Guided Tour (Beta) is a great new tool to use, although only a maximum of 30 geographical 
	points can be made per map. </li>
	<li>Due to the limitations of points per map a creative solution was engineered.</li>
</li>
